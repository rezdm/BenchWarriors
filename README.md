Comparing LINQ, Stream, etc in different languages 

This projects started after a discussion on performance improvements in .NET Core vs .NET Framework. I did a small experiment (see NET folder) and ran the same code running in FW 4.8.1 vs Core 9.
Later I decided to extend the project and add more languages:

C#, .NET9
Java 17+
C++ 17+

Planned:
SQL
JS
Rust
Go
